# Pre-processing in Natural Language Processing projects. 

The purpose of this repository is to understand the various pre-processing techniques applied to NLP tasks. We take a sample input dataset known as the [Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type). The dataset is used to predict the personality of the user based on their social media posts. 

The input data is split into two columns: 

## Type

This is the personality type of the user as based on the MBTI classes. There are 4 different classifications based on personality type yielding a total of 16 different combinations. For each person, we ask:

•	Whether someone would prefer dealing with people directly and learn from their external environment (Extraversion) or if they would perceive, gain insights and obtain ideas internally (Introversion). 

•	Whether someone would want to deal with things that they would already know or feel from one of their senses (Sensing) or if they would want to trust what they believe is right even though they would not have experienced it for themselves (Intuition).

•	Whether someone would make a decision based on logical thinking and coming up with a conclusion (Thinking) or if they prefer making a decision based on their “gut” (Feeling). 

•	Whether someone would want everything planned out (Judgment) or just have no plan and make one along the way (Perception).
